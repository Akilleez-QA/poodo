# Contributing to POODO

Describe the concrete problem, proposed behavior, and evidence that would distinguish improvement from extra ceremony. Small, reproducible examples are useful.

## Development

Follow the [setup and checks](docs/getting-started.md). Python tooling depends only on the standard library and pinned PyYAML. Run the package validator and regression suite before submitting a change.

Preserve explicit invocation and the existing 3.0 method unless proposing a clearly identified method revision. Explain effects on evidence separation, authority, research, divergence, contradiction handling, and continuity. Keep client-specific capabilities conditional on actual availability.

For checker fixes, include a minimal failing input and a regression test with meaningful assertions. For behavioral claims, follow the [evaluation guide](docs/evaluation.md); passing syntax checks is insufficient.

## Issues and pull requests

Include the relevant version/commit, expected behavior, actual behavior, reproduction steps, and a sanitized fixture or trace. Separate observed failures from suspected causes. State which checks ran and which outcomes remain untested.

Keep examples synthetic or explicitly authorized for publication. Remove secrets, private paths, customer details, and unrelated conversation records before sharing. Cite external foundations and preserve their licenses when including third-party material.

The existing behavioral thresholds are proposals. Any adopted thresholds and rubric applicability must be fixed before examining trial outcomes.
