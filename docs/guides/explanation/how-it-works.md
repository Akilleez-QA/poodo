# How POODO works

POODO is a set of instructions for an agent. Its purpose is to keep a decision tied to evidence and a testable outcome as the work progresses.

| Phase | Question | Useful output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pontificate | What work and outcome does the user mean? | Objective, scope, authority, assumptions |
| Observe | What is actually known? | Evidence records and web research |
| Orient | What explanations and paths survive scrutiny? | A mapped problem space, 20 distinct paths, credible rivals |
| Decide | What should happen under these constraints? | Commitment, tradeoffs, reversal conditions |
| Orchestrate | How will authorized action produce and verify the outcome? | Work plan, prospective prediction, observations |

Read the exact requirements in [SKILL.md](../../../SKILL.md); this introduction does not replace them.

## Three distinctions that matter

**A report is not an observation.** A prior summary can tell an agent where to look. It cannot independently prove the underlying claim.

**A structural check is not an outcome test.** A matching hash says something about artifact identity. It says nothing by itself about whether the user can finish a task.

**A plausible cause is not a demonstrated cause.** Keep a credible rival explanation and identify an observation that would distinguish them.

## Before action

Record the predicted effect, criterion, oracle version, exact artifact and environment, failure meaning, monitoring, rollback, and stop condition. Changing the criterion after observing the result creates a new prospective test; it does not repair the old outcome.

When an observation contradicts a load-bearing prediction, narrow the claim before explaining the cause. A concern about the test is not proof that the test was invalid.

## Across sessions

A continuation capsule preserves objective, authority, evidence locators, artifact identity, contradictions, and the next checkpoint. Re-read the required evidence when resuming. See [continuity and ledger](../../../references/continuity-and-ledger.md) for the schema.

The checker validates a structural subset of one capsule. It cannot inspect the world behind evidence links or compare sibling capsule branches.

## Cost and fit

Mandatory research and divergent exploration make the full loop inappropriate for simple questions. Stop at a precise evidence boundary if required research is unavailable. For complex work, the working records can be detailed while the user-facing answer stays concise.

## The loop in pseudocode

A developer's sketch of the control flow. It is illustrative, not executable, and it does not replace [SKILL.md](../../../SKILL.md), which remains the authoritative contract.

```python
def poodo(request, authority):
    # Authority comes only from the user. Reasoning, delegation, compaction,
    # confidence, and prior action never expand it.

    # ── PONTIFICATE: frame the problem before gathering evidence ──   [references/pontificate.md]
    if not context_clearly_establishes(work, ideal_outcome):
        ask_user("What are you working on? What does the ideal outcome look like?")
    frame = decompress(request)        # objective, acceptance criteria, scope, authority,
                                       # stakes, assumptions, unknowns, rival framings
    frame.separate(user_stated, agent_inferred)
    frame.rival = strongest_rival_frame(frame)
    checkpoint("Pontificate -> Observe")

    while True:
        # ── OBSERVE: establish what is actually known ──   [references/observe.md]
        evidence = gather(frame)       # each record: source, locator, freshness, evidence
                                       # family, scope, and what it does NOT establish
        topology = map_neighborhood(frame, evidence)   # meanings, mechanisms, dependencies,
                                                       # stakeholders, failure modes, unknowns
        if user_selected("Mega Observe"):              # optional, expensive, explicit only

        research = deep_web_research(topology, include_disconfirming_queries=True)
        if not research.satisfied:     # no web access, snippets only, one convenient source...

        viable = cluster_and_eliminate(paths)          # every rejection keeps a reason
        favored, rival = rank(viable), strongest_credible_rival(viable)
        discriminator = observation_that_separates(favored, rival)
        checkpoint("Orient -> Decide")

        # ── DECIDE: the 20 paths are a design space, not a ballot ──   [references/decide.md]
        decision = compose(viable)     # select, combine, sequence, condition, test,
                                       # defer, or escalate any subset
        decision.reverse_if = reversal_conditions(decision)

        checkpoint("Decide -> Orchestrate")

        # ── ORCHESTRATE: precommit, then act and verify ──   [references/orchestrate.md]
        prediction = precommit(        # recorded BEFORE observing the outcome
            observable, acceptance_boundary, oracle, oracle_version,
            artifact_identity, environment, failure_meaning,
            monitoring, rollback, stop_condition)
        outcome = execute_authorized(decision, monitor=True)
        checkpoint("Orchestrate -> Loop")

            prediction.status = "failed"               # or "failed_with_test_concern";
                                                       # "invalid" only with outcome-independent proof
            reopen(dependents_of(prediction))
            restore(rival)
            frame = frame.with_contradiction(outcome)  # new prediction ID on any retest
            continue
        if validated_in_named_scope(outcome) or justified_decision_and_next_action() \
                or precise_evidence_or_authority_gap():

                required_runtime_observation,
                who_controls_next_test)
        frame = frame.with_learning(outcome)   # promote learning only with provenance + scope


def checkpoint(boundary):
    # Run at every stage transition.   [references/fan-out-spikes.md, references/continuity-and-ledger.md]
    if separable_workstreams_could_change(boundary):
        results = fan_out(workers_with_distinct_questions_or_evidence)  # bounded, read-only by default
        reconcile_into_ledger(results)         # agents sharing sources != independent corroboration
    record(fanout_used, reason_if_not)
    if handoff or pause or compaction_imminent:
        emit_continuation_capsule()            # state metadata, never evidence
```

Throughout, claim states stay separate: a report is not an observation, a passing structural check is not a runtime outcome, and a plausible cause is not a demonstrated one.

## Mega Observe (expensive)

An optional research mode for a large semantic map: **200 distinct categories × 200 distinct evaluations each = 40,000 substantive records**. Invoke it explicitly:

```text
Use $poodo in Mega Observe mode to map this problem space. First prepare
its scope, source plan, quality criteria, and cost estimate. Do not begin
the expensive run until a resource ceiling is established.
```

Each category and evaluation must earn its place through a distinct, relevant question and traceable evidence or a documented knowledge gap. Duplicate headings, generic text, unsupported certainty, and invented citations fail the quality gate. If 200 meaningful categories cannot be supported, the result is incomplete.

The mode can require substantial inference and review, potentially hundreds of dollars depending on the host and models. It uses budget checkpoints and resumable records. This repository supplies the [protocol](../../../references/mega-observe.md) and [charter](../../../assets/mega-observe-charter.yaml); it does not include a crawler, paid execution service, or a billing cap implementation.

Literal coverage of the entire internet cannot be verified. The output must report the searched corpus, exclusions, uncertainty, and remaining frontier. The 200 × 200 design is experimental; neither spending nor record count proves completeness.
